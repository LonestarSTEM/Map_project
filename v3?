// Not sure if this works becuase I don't have an arduino with me atm, but let me know if this is any help. I kinda just put this together with the previous code we had and some documentation I read online. Not sure if any of this is currently working.
// One question I had was with the pin numbers, Will we need to distinguish which ones are side A&B or will the libraries help with that. let me know.
